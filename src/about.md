# About HQ→CO2

__Private companies are largely responsible for the global warming crisis.__ 63% of all greenhouse gas emissions from 1751 to 2010 were produced by just 90 companies.

HQ→CO2 is an attempt to visualize how every day, decisions made by executives in corporate headquarters are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions that pose an enormous threat to our planet.
