  <p>
    <strong>
      Private companies are largely responsible for the global warming crisis.
    </strong>
    63% of all greenhouse gas emissions from 1751 to 2010 were produced by just
    90 companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    HQ→CO2 is an attempt to visualize how every day, decisions made by
    executives in corporate headquarters are contributing to greenhouse gas
    emissions that pose an enormous threat to our planet.
